            <h2>About Our Lab</h2>
            <p>The AIM-HI Lab at Cleveland Clinic's Department of Urology is dedicated to developing and applying artificial intelligence solutions to improve kidney cancer diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient outcomes. Our research focuses on three key areas: automating nephrometry scoring for surgical planning, developing AI-powered frailty assessment tools, and leveraging large language models for efficient clinical data extraction. By combining cutting-edge AI technologies with clinical expertise, we aim to enhance the precision and efficiency of kidney cancer care while maintaining the highest standards of patient safety and data privacy.</p>

                    <p class="description">This paper introduces AI Age Discrepancy, a novel metric derived from machine learning analysis of preoperative abdominal CT scans, as a potential indicator of frailty and postoperative risk in kidney cancer patients. This retrospective study of 599 patients from the 2023 Kidney Tumor Segmentation (KiTS) challenge dataset found that a higher AI Age Discrepancy is significantly associated with longer hospital stays and lower overall survival rates, independent of established factors.</p>

                    <p class="description">Leveraging deep learning for semantic segmentation of kidney CT scans (n = 300), this work automatically computes R.E.N.A.L. nephrometry scores ("AI-Scores") and compares them to human-expert ("H-Scores"). AI-Scores showed substantial concordance with H-Scores (Lin's ρ = 0.59) and proved equally predictive of malignancy, high tumor grade/stage, and key perioperative metrics (e.g., surgical approach, estimated blood loss). By removing manual scoring variability and saving clinician time, the AI-based system aims to facilitate broader adoption of standardized nephrometry in renal tumor care.</p>

                    <p class="description">This survey-based study (n = 264) assessed how laypersons perceive AI and robotic surgery in oncologic care. Although most participants expressed similar trust in physician vs. AI‐based diagnoses, they were significantly more likely to trust AI for cancer detection when primed to believe AI can diagnose. Additionally, 88% mistakenly thought partial autonomy in robotic surgery already exists, and over half reported discomfort with robotic procedures—highlighting the need for clear patient counseling as AI/robotic tools become more prevalent.</p>
