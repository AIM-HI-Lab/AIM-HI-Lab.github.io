                    <p class="description">The RENAL and PADUA nephrometry scores are tools often used in managing kidney tumors that offer quantifiable measures of tumor complexity to guide surgical planning and predict outcomes. Though clinically useful, the manual calculation of these scores is labor-intensive and prone to significant interobserver variability, resulting in inconsistencies in diagnostic interpretation that could result in suboptimal outcomes. This study explores using artificial intelligence (AI) to automate the generation of RENAL and PADUA scores. By utilizing machine learning models trained on a comprehensive dataset of abdominal CT scans, the study aims to enhance the reliability and efficiency of nephrometry scoring, potentially improving the precision of clinical decision-making in kidney cancer management.</p>

This retrospective study of 599 patients from the 2023 Kidney Tumor Segmentation (KiTS) challenge dataset found that a higher AI Age Discrepancy is significantly associated with longer hospital stays and lower overall survival rates, independent of established factors.</p>

                    <p class="description">Clinical databases are essential for clinical and translational research. Traditionally, curating a clinical database involves manually collecting data from free text notes within the electronic medical record (EMR), but this process is time-consuming and error prone. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini have demonstrated impressive semantic understanding of free text, and could be used to automate the free text data extraction tasks that once could only be done using human experts and trainees. Unfortunately, these free text notes often contain protected health information, and moreover embody a valuable asset, leading health systems to restrict their transfer to entities like the third party AI providers mentioned above. The goal of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of avoiding data transfer by using an open source AI model to generate a clinical database.</p>
