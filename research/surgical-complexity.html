                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>Our research in surgical complexity focuses on developing and validating AI systems for automated nephrometry scoring and surgical risk assessment. We have developed multiple AI-based scoring systems, including R.E.N.A.L., R.E.N.A.L.+, PADUA, C-Index, and tumor CSA, that demonstrate superior or equivalent predictive utility compared to human-generated scores. Additionally, we have pioneered the concept of "AI Age Discrepancy" as a novel metric for frailty assessment in kidney tumor patients. Our work spans from basic algorithm development to clinical validation and implementation, with a focus on improving surgical planning, risk stratification, and patient outcomes through automated, objective assessment tools.</p>

                            <p class="description">This study introduces "AI Age Discrepancy," a novel metric derived from machine learning analysis of preoperative abdominal CT scans. The metric assesses the difference between a patient's chronological age and the age predicted by AI based on imaging. A higher AI Age Discrepancy correlates with longer hospital stays and lower overall survival rates in kidney cancer patients, suggesting its potential as an indicator of frailty and postoperative risk.</p>

                            <p class="description">The research focuses on automating three validated nephrometry scoring systems—C-Index, PADUA, and tumor CSA—using AI-based image processing methods on preoperative CT scans. The study found that AI-generated scores are equivalent or superior to human-generated scores in predicting pathological and perioperative outcomes in renal cancer patients.</p>

                            <p class="description">The research aimed to automate the R.E.N.A.L. nephrometry scoring system using a deep neural network to analyze preoperative CT scans.
